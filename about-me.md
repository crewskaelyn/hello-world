# About Me

My name is **Kaelyn Crews**, and I am a student at the University of Missouri. I am in pursuit of an Information Technology major as well as a Psychology minor. I am currently a junior.

I grew up in a *very* small town with my younger sister and my mom. We have 3 dogs, one of which is mine and lives in Columbia with me. Mine is a catahoula/boxer mix, and the other two are dachsunds.
